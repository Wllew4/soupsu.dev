        <p class="h1 text">Terms of Service</p>
        <p class="p text">The purpose of this document is to outline the processes and policies for commissioning art from me.
            Although I do not open commissions often, the integrity of such processes as well as the right for my clients to be
            informed of such processes is important to me. Throughout this document, "you" refers to the commissioner.</p>
        <br><p class="h2 text">The Process</p>
        <p class="p text">Commission openings are posted on my
            <a class="p text" target="_blank" href="https://t.me/felixstash">Telegram Channel</a> and
            <a class="p text" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/soupsu_">Twitter</a>.
            <br>
            When I am open for commissions, you may claim a slot by direct messaging me on 
            <a class="p text" target="_blank" href="https://t.me/felixgolfoi">Telegram</a> or 
            <a class="p text" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/soupsu_">Twitter</a>.
            Prices can be found on <a class="p text" target="_blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/soupsu">TBD</a>.
            <br><br>
            Before I can start work on your commission, I need each of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="p text">(Safe-For-Work) Reference Sheet,</li> 
                <li class="p text">Prompt (pose, clothing, etc.), </li>
                <li class="p text">An email address associated with your PayPal account.</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="p text">
            Once I receive each of these I will begin work on the sketch. The "sketch" is a quick, rough, starting point to verify
            that I have correctly understood your prompt.
            Once you approve the sketch, I will send an invoice to you via PayPal. The invoice must be paid before I continue with the commission.
            Also, after you approve of the sketch and pay the invoice, refunds are no longer available.
            <br><br>
            When the piece is at a completed stage, I will send it to you as a direct message. At this point, refunds are not available, but I will make any small changes
            to the piece that you need for free. Once you approve of the final product, I will email you the full resolution image files.
        </p>
        <br><p class="h2 text">Payment</p>
        <p class="p text">
            Payment is only accepted via PayPal. When the sketch is approved I will send an invoice to the email you provide me.
            I will continue with the commission when the invoice is paid.
        </p>
        <br><p class="h2 text">Refunds</p>
        <p class="p text">
            Generally, refunds will not occur. The invoice is not sent until the sketch is approved. I will not accept refunds once the sketch is approved.
            I will issue a full refund if I decide to cancel your commission.
        </p>
        <br><p class="h2 text">Ownership of Art</p>
        <p class="p text">
            You have the right to post the art on your social media. You may not claim to have made the art.
            I ask that you credit me, but I will not take action if you do not.
            <br>
            You may not remove my watermark from the art.
            <br>
            You are allowed to edit the piece so long as the edit is done without the intent to "fix" the piece. I.e. you may crop/rotate the piece, add a hat, funny distortions, etc.
            You may not attempt to correct the line art or colors. If you need "correctional" changes like those, please ask me.
        </p>
        <br><p class="h2 text">Additional Terms</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="p text">I reserve the right to cancel your commission at any time for any reason I deem necessary. If I decide to do this, you will receive a full refund.</li> 
            <li class="p text">I reserve the right to deny a commission for any reason.</li>
            <li class="p text">Here is a (not all-encompassing) list of things that I will not draw as a commission: nsfw, fetish art, blood/gore, candy gore, drug use.</li>
        </ul>
