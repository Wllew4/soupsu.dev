My [website](https://soupsu.live).
Currently used as a small hub for social media links/redirects.
I plan to use it as a portfolio when I have more projects worth displaying/documenting.

Don't look at previous commits, it's a mess.
I know a lot more now than I used to.

## Roadmap
1. June 2022 - Switch from Heroku to Linode (my free Heroku credits are running out; Linode is cheaper and gives me IaaS capabilities as opposed to Heroku, which is PaaS).
2. August 2022 - Switch from .live to .dev domain (.dev is cheaper and better represents my profile as a developer).
