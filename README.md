My [website](https://soupsu.dev).
Previously [soupsu.live](https://soupsu.live). This domain will expire in 2022.

Currently used as a small hub for social media links/redirects.
Looking to make it into a portfolio in the future.

Open sourced to serve as an example of my work. Also helps to give an example
project to others looking to use a similar design pattern/workflow.

## Roadmap
1. June 2022 - Switch from Heroku to Linode (my free student Heroku credits are running out; Linode is cheaper and gives me IaaS capabilities as opposed to Heroku, which is PaaS).
